Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. _A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory_. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=TzJ2L9ZmlQUC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A problem marked by \* is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.

Problem Set 3
-------------

*   Due in Session 8
*   Practice Problems
    *   Session 6: Chapter 5: Exercises 11, 12, 13
    *   Session 7: Chapter 5: Exercises 1, 5, 16
*   Problems Assigned in the Textbook
    *   Chapter 5: Exercise 21
    *   Chapter 5: Exercise 34. Only do the case k=1, which is already pretty tricky and in my opinion deserves a (+)
*   Additional Problems
    *   (A2) Let λ be a partition with conjugate λ'. Show that
    
    Σ _i_ ⌊λ2_i-1_/2⌋ = Σ _i_ ⌈λ'_2i_/2⌉.  
    This can be seen almost by inspection from the Young diagram of λ after certain marks are made on it. _Note_. The notation ⌊_x_⌋ means the greatest integer ≤_x_. For instance, ⌊3⌋=3, ⌊3/2⌋=1. Similarly ⌈_x_⌉ means the least integer ≥_x_. For instance, ⌈3⌉=3, ⌈3/2⌉=2.
    
    *   (A3) Show by simple combinatorial reasoning and induction that the Bell number B(_n_) is even if and only if _n_\-2 is divisible by 3.
*   Bonus Problems
    *   None
